## 🤖 How It Works

Unlike generic AI rewriters, PaperMirror acts as a **Quantitative Linguistic Engineer**. It doesn't just "fix grammar"; it mathematically aligns your writing style with your target journal.

1.  **Style Extraction**: It analyzes your uploaded **Sample Paper** to extract a precise stylistic fingerprint, calculating metrics like:
    *   *Sentence Length Distribution* (Rhythm)
    *   *Lexical Density & Complexity* (Vocabulary Tier)
    *   *Passive/Active Voice Ratio* (Objectivity Tone)
2.  **Contextual Awareness**: It scans your entire draft to understand the macro-structure (Abstract → Conclusion), ensuring the rewritten text maintains perfect logical flow.
3.  **Style Transfer**: Using **GLM-4.5-Air**, it rewrites your draft chunk-by-chunk to match the extracted fingerprint.
    *   **3 Intensity Levels**: *Conservative* (Polish), *Standard* (Balance), and *Enhanced* (Native Restructuring).

*Designed for PhD students, ESL researchers, and academics aiming for journals like Nature, Science, or IEEE/ACM Transactions.*
